gem 'rack-cors', '~> 1.1', '>= 1.1.1'
 
# Phonelib is a gem allowing you to validate phone numbers.
# All validations are based on Google libphonenumber. Cur-
# rently it can make basic validations and formatting to
# e164 international number format and national number for-
# mat with prefix. But it still doesn’t include all Google’s
# library functionality.
gem 'phonelib', '~> 0.8', '~> 0.8.2'

# The activerecord-postgis-adapter provides access to
# features of the PostGIS geospatial database from
# ActiveRecord. It extends the standard postgresql adapter
# to provide support for the spatial data types and features
# added by the PostGIS extension. It uses the RGeo library
# to represent spatial data in Ruby.
gem 'activerecord-postgis-adapter'

#  Here are a few examples showing how to use the Ruby SDK:
#
#   Verifying US street addresses
#   Verifying international street addresses
#   Finding US ZIP Codes
#   Extracting US street addresses from arbitrary text
#   Completing US street addresses given an prefix

# processor list.
gem "mainstreet"

# Provides object geocoding (by street or IP address),
# reverse geocoding (coordinates to street address),
#distance queries for ActiveRecord and Mongoid, result
# caching, and more. Designed for Rails but works with
# Sinatra and other Rack frameworks too.
gem 'geocoder', '~> 1.3', '>= 1.3.7'

# An email validator for Rails 3+
# The default validation provided by this gem (the :loose
# configuration option) is extremely loose. It just checks
# that there's an @ with something before and after it
# without any whitespace.
#
# We understand that many use cases require an increased
# level of validation. This is supported by using the
# :strict validation mode.
gem 'email_validator', :require => 'email_validator/strict'

# gem 'country_select' provides a simple helper to get an
# HTML select list of countries using the ISO 3166-1 standard.
#
# While the ISO 3166 standard is a relatively neutral source
# of country names, it may still offend some users. Developers
# are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this
# list given their user base.
gem 'country_select', '~> 8.0'

# dry-types is a simple and extendable type system for Ruby;
# useful for value coercions, applying constraints, defining
# complex structs or value objects and more. It was created
# as a successor to Virtus.
gem 'dry-types', '~> 1.7', '~> 1.7.1'

# dry-struct is a gem built on top of dry-types which provides
# virtus-like DSL for defining typed struct classes.
gem 'dry-struct', '~> 1.6', '~> 1.6.0'

# dry-validation is a data validation library that provides a
# powerful DSL for defining schemas and validation rules.
#
# Validations are expressed through contract objects. A contract
# specifies a schema with basic type checks and any additional
# rules that should be applied. Contract rules are applied only
# once the values they rely on have been succesfully verified by
# the schema.
gem 'dry-validation', '~> 1.10', '~> 1.10.0'

# dry-monads is a set of common monads for Ruby. Monads provide
# an elegant way of handling errors, exceptions and chaining
# functions so that the code is much more understandable and has
# all the error handling, without all the ifs and elses.
gem 'dry-monads', '~> 1.6', '~> 1.6.0'

# dry-configurable is a simple mixin to add thread-safe configur-
# ation behavior to your classes. There are many libraries that
# make use of the configuration, and each seemed to have its own
# implementation with a similar or duplicate interface, so we
# thought it was strange that this behavior had not already been
# encapsulated into a reusable gem, hence dry-configurable was born.
gem 'dry-configurable', '~> 1.1', '~> 1.1.0'

# Object dependency management system based on dry-container and
# dry-auto_inject allowing you to configure reusable components
# in any environment, set up their load-paths, require needed files
# and instantiate objects automatically with the ability to have#
# them injected as dependencies.

gem 'dry-system', '~> 1.0', '~> 1.0.1'

# Ruby gem for colorizing text using ANSI escape sequences.
# Extends String class or add a ColorizedString with methods
# to set the text color, background color and text effects.
gem 'colorize'

# BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very
# accurate floating point numbers. Decimal arithmetic is also
# useful for general calculation, because it provides the correct
# answers people expect–whereas normal binary floating point
# arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the con-
# version between base 10 and base 2.
gem 'bigdecimal', '~> 3.1', '>= 3.1.4'
